Dragon Escape:

A mathmatically-awesome game!

What do I do in this game?

In this game you will click on the crystals that have a random value until your total equals the dragon's favorite number. If you pass his number you will lose a life and try again. If you equal the favorite number then you will go to next level with a different dragon and a different number to equal. You will do this until you reach the end where you can escape out of the dragons' cave.
